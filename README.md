# A-Comparative-Study-of-DETR-and-YOLO-on-Traffic-Object-Detection

In this work, we have compared YOLO and DETRâ€™s performances in carrying out traffic object detection tasks under the constraints of transfer learning and efficiency. Pre-trained and fine-tuned models are evaluated on the KITTI dataset, with Metric scores including mean Average Precision (mAP), class accuracy, and inference time
